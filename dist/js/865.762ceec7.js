The map’s innovation was to show Russia not as its Czar (or, as also was quite common, the Russian bear), but as a belligerent octopus. The legend explains the contemporary geopolitical context of the map: \\n\\nThe Octopus (Russia, the great glutton) no longer thinks about the wounds received during the Crimean War, and advances its armies in all directions. After having stemmed the Turk’s advance, the Russian marches forward, hoping to crush Turkey like he did with Poland. It seems Greece is also desirous to occupy and exhaust Turkey from another direction. Hungary is restrained only by its sister Austria from attacking Russia. France, still smarting from its recent defeat, is studiously inspecting its arsenal. Germany is observing France’s movements, and is prepared for all eventualities. \\n\\nGreat Britain and Ireland are carefully monitoring the situation, and are prepared to prevent Russia from imposing itself on Turkey, or interfering in the Suez.

Its premise was the writer\'s imaginary gate-crashing of a summer dinner party held by Disraeli for an assortment of political allies & opponents at his Buckinghamshire country residence, Hughenden Manor. As well as Disraeli himself, the cast of richly satirized characters includes Foreign Secretary, Lord Derby (Dord Lerby), William Gladstone (Sweet William), George Ward Hunt (Hard Hunt) (First Lord of the Admiralty), Sir William Harcourt (Sir Verdant Hardcoat), Robert Lowe (Lob Rowe), Sir Richard Cross (Home Secretary), John Bright, Sir Stafford Northcote (Chancellor of the Exchequer), Sir Wilfrid Lawson (Sir Wellfried Lawson), and George Goschen.\\nThe evening dinner party scenario provides the platform for a series of discursive comic poems, humorous stories, lively discussions & informal asides, most relating to the political situation in Europe and focusing principally the thorny issue of the \\"Eastern Question\\". By Page 38, the Foreign Secretary, Lord Derby (Dord Lerby), outlines the danger of Russian advances in Asia, especially towards Imperial India, noting that:\\nRussia is a political octopus. Her limbs are stretched out in every direction both in Europe and Asia, and she is slowly but surely dragging to their doom not only Servia, Montenegro, Bosnia, the Herzogovina, and Bulgaria, but quite as certainly Khiva, Persia and Afghanistan...\\n\\nThis is the charming sketch by illustrator \\"Whew\\" that accompanies the quote, depicting a Russian octopus, in the guise of the Tsar, his tentacles reaching out across a map of Eastern Europe & Central Asia, just as Lord Derby (Dord Lerby) describes:\\n\\nIt is my strong belief that Rose almost certainly acquired a copy of Benjamin D- His Little Dinner, and that this simple octopus sketch provided the direct spark of inspiration for his subsequent design of the Octopus War map,\\npublished just a few months later in the early summer of 1877.","Source of the Description":"Politics personified: Fred W.

Revised Edition.","Description":"This famous \\"Octopus\\" satirical map was first published in March 1877, two months after Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in response to the Turkish massacre of Christian Bulgarians (represented here by a skull). See generally Barber 2005, 284; Barron 2016a; Barron 2016b, 17-18. A lengthy legend on the map explains the position of the great powers and affected countries, and Barber 2005 provides additional detail.This map \\"is generally considered the British graphic artist Fred Rose\'s cartographic masterpiece\\" (Barber 2005), \\"an internationally recognized visual propagandist trope\\" (Barron 2016, 15). Rose was identified in the first edition only as \\"F.W.R.,\\" although an edition a few weeks later was ascribed to \\"F.W. Rose.\\" The map quickly became popular, and this \\"Revised Edition\\" was published in July 1877 on a smaller scale and with a larger octopus threatening a larger geographic area in the Mid-East and Central Asia. Barron 2016b. The Revised Edition included a \\"new and more extensive bi-lingual key in both English and German.\\" Ibid. 26 n.5.Rose \\"crystallized, formalized and refined\\" the genre of European political cartoon maps (Barron 2008, 11), but for more than a century almost nothing was known about him apart from the importance of his work. Thanks to determined recent research, we now know quite a bit. See generally Worms 2014; Barron 2016b. Rose had a day job: he was a British civil servant for 42 years, rising to become the Deputy Principal Clerk in the Legacy Duty Office of the Inland Revenue at the time of his retirement. He supplemented his income with caricatures and articles for newspapers and journals. Barron 2016, 16. He wrote two sensational novels, one about racy romantic affairs among the fashionable, the other about what we today would call a serial killer. Worms 2014. And he was a dedicated Tory from his teenage years, \\"forever affiliated to the Conservative cause\\" who maintained \\"a lifelong engagement with local Conservative political associations and organisations.\\" Barron 2016b, 17.Rose\'s political views shed light on the Octopus map. The Liberals were hostile to the Ottoman Empire, particularly after the slaughter of the Bulgarian Slavs, and Gladstone had called for removal of the Turks \\"bag and baggage\\" from the Balkans. The Conservative administration under Disraeli saw the Turks as an important counterweight to Russian territorial expansion, and were particularly concerned that if Russia captured Constantinople, it would have a warm-water port on the Mediterranean, uncomfortably close to the new Suez Canal. This map reflects the views of the \\"pro-Turkish Russophobe Tories\\" in opposition to those of the \\"anti-Turkish Russophile Liberals.\\" Ibid. 18.The Octopus map was very successful, in Britain and (particularly because of the absence of international copyright protection) elsewhere in Europe. For references to editions in Danish, Swedish, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian and French, as well as an American edition, see Barron 2016a. Indeed, the map was so well known that when Rose produced another landmark satirical map 22 years later (\\"Angling in Troubled Waters,\\" ID #1135), the creator was identified as \\"Fred. W. Rose, Author of the \'Octopus\' Map of Europe.\\"The octopus is a persistent trope in persuasive cartography. It first appeared in Frederick Rose\'s \\"Serio-Comic War Map For The Year 1877,\\" ID #2272, about the Russo-Turkish War. \\"Once Fred W. Rose had created the \'Octopus\' map of Europe, it proved difficult to rid propaganda maps of them.\\" Barber 2010, 164. \\"The prevalence of the octopus motif in later maps suggests that the octopus also spoke to humanity\'s primeval fears, evoking a terrifying and mysterious creature from the depths (the dark outer places of the world) that convincingly conjured a sense of limitless evil.\\" Baynton-Williams 2015, 180.The collection includes numerous maps - from Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Latin America, the Netherlands and the U.S. - employing the octopus motif. (Search > “octopus”.) Many of these relate to imperialism and war, from 1877 to the Cold War. Others attack social and political targets, including a \\"reactionary\\" journalist, the Standard Oil monopoly, “Landlordism,” mail order houses, Jews and Mormons.","Source of the Description":"PJ Mode Collection: Serio-Comic War Map For The Year 1877.

It is the cover illustration of “Political Aspects of Mormonism,” by Rev. Josiah Strong, one of a series of at least seven anti-Mormon pamphlets published by the League for Social Justice which he founded at the end of the 19th century.This pamphlet is directed primarily at the Mormon view of “the divine authority of the priesthood,” which Strong attacks as a “source of evils of all sorts,” resulting in “ecclesiastical despotism.” p.5. “Thus the fundamental doctrine of the Mormon Church brings it into necessary conflict with republican institutions, destroys liberty and reduces its victims to a double slavery - religious and political.” pp. 7-8. Strong also criticizes the expansionist “designs” of the Church, quoting an earlier Bishop’s statement that “We look forward with perfect confidence to the day when we will hold the reins of the United States government.” p. 8.Josiah Strong was a prominent evangelical Protestant leader at the turn of the 20th century. Strong’s views are difficult to reconcile when viewed through the lens of today’s cultural norms. On the one hand, he believed fervently in the superiority of “the Anglo-Saxon race” and was aggressively hostile not only to Mormonism, but to Catholicism. He was opposed to immigration - particularly to the immigration of Catholics - but happy to make exception for Anglo Saxons. And his best-known work was a racial justification of American imperialism in the Philippines. See generally Berge 1973.On the other hand, Strong was committed to addressing the problems of the cities, including education, political corruption, sanitation, the concentration of wealth and labor conditions. He supported labor arbitration and profit sharing. He advocated for the organization of reform groups, as well as adoption of the popular initiative, referendum and recall, all supported by the collection and distribution of sociological data to inform the public. His personal friends included icons of the Progressive Movement like Rabbi Stephen S. Wise and Theodore Roosevelt. Muller 1959, 183, 185, 189, 194, 197.

While Marianne is shown looking glumly at broken toys labelled with the names of political and diplomatic incidents, Germany is represented by the Kaiser in uniform stockpiling battleships and exports, and Russia is an octopus with the Czar at its centre. One could argue that proximity is the defining factor: France is close to England and had perhaps been visited by the artist and his expected reader.

It depicts \\"Standard Oil\\" as a great octopus spread out across the U.S., having strangled state capitals and the Congress in Washington, reaching out \\"Next\\" in an effort to seize the White House.\\n\\nTheodore Roosevelt, seeking election on his own right after succeeding McKinley, was opposed by the Democratic nominee, Alton B. Parker, Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. Roosevelt had established his credentials in fighting the monopolies, particularly by initiating and winning the landmark Northern Securities case against a massive proposed railroad merger backed by J.P. Morgan. Goodwin 2013, chs. 10, 14. Although Parker\'s views on anti-trust matters were close to those of Roosevelt, he was called \\"the chosen tool of Standard Oil\\" after the Democratic Convention in July when one of his principal backers, Senator Patrick McCarren of New York, was accused of being on the company\'s payroll. Debs 1908, 369.\\n\\nThe country was very much focused on the Standard Oil monopoly during the election campaign as a result of a series of detailed and widely-read exposés by Ida Tarbell, a leading muck-raking journalist of the time. Tarbell\'s articles had been serialized in McClure\'s Magazine beginning in 1903 and appeared in book form in 1904. See generally Goodwin 2013, ch. 11. Her work concluded that \\"the ascendancy of the company was aided at every stage by discriminatory railroad rates and illegal tactics - bribery, fraud, criminal underselling, and intimidation.” Ibid. 336. She closed with an admonition: \\"And what are we going to do about it? For it is OUR business, we, the people of the United States, and nobody else, must cure whatever is wrong in the industrial situation, typified by this narrative of the growth of the Standard Oil Company.” Ibid. 338-39. (Interestingly, Tarbell herself had often referred to Standard Oil as an octopus in her personal correspondence. Ibid. 336, 442.)\\n\\nRoosevelt won reelection in 1904 in a landslide, with a popular majority of 56 to 37 percent. In November 1906, his administration brought a massive antitrust suit against Standard Oil under the Sherman Act of 1890. The government won in the trial court, and in May 1911, the Supreme Court upheld the trial court\'s decision and ordered Standard Oil dissolved.","Source of the Description":"P.J.

It follows the design used by the Englishman Frederick Rose (cited in the text as \\"a certain prominant Englishman\\") for a similar map first published in 1877, ID #2275. Harwood 2006, 128. The Russian octopus\'s tentacles are everywhere, grasping at Finland, Poland, the Balkans, \\"Cremia\\" (plus ca change), Turkey, Persia, and Tibet. Most importantly here, a tentacle reaches across Manchuria to Korea and Port Arthur. The map is dated March 1904, after the successful Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur, but while the fighting was continuing. See generally Curtis 2016, 8-11; Baynton-Williams 2015, 196; Harmon 2004, 116-17.The Russo-Japanese war was primarily a series of naval engagements, and this map was intended at least in part to influence Britain to maintain its neutrality - that is, to keep its powerful fleet out of the war. The clearest evidence of the mapmaker\'s objective is the fact that the title, country names and the lengthy text bloc all appear in English. The text reads as follows:\\"\'Black Octopus\' is a name newly given to Russia by a certain prominent Englishman. For the black octopus is so avaricious, that he stretches out his eight arms in all directions, and seizes up every thing that comes within his reach. But as it sometimes happens he gets wounded seriously even by a small fish, owing to his too much covetousness. Indeed, a Japanese proverb says: \'Great avarice is like unselfishness.\' We Japanese need not to say much on the cause of the present war. Suffice it to say that the further existence of the Black Octopus will depend entirely upon how he comes out of this war. The Japanese fleet has already practically annihilated Russia\'s naval powers in the Orient. The Japanese army is about to win a signal victory over Russia in Corea and Manchuria. And when ... St. Petersburg? Wait & see! The ugly Black Octopus! Hurrah! Hurrah! for Japan. - Kisaburo Ohara, March 1904.”","Source of the Description":"P.J.

In the public mind, Jews were often linked with Masons and accused of forming an international cabal for the subversion of Christian society. La Bastille—“the Illustrated Weekly Anti-Masonic Newspaper”—fed off these anxieties and had a decent publishing run from 1902-1915. It was one of at least three similarly-minded publications overseen by Paul Copin-Albancelli and Louis Dasté (a pseudonym for André Baron).\\nOffered here is a mammoth chromolithographic poster promoting La Bastille and its message, which would have been affixed in a public space to drive bulk sales (“1f. 50 le cent, 10 f. le mille”). It central motif is a vast octopus with a crudely stereotypical Jewish face (large nose, dark complexion, thick red lips), wearing masonic symbols (compass and square, gold rings, &c), and spreading its tentacles across France to grasp eight figures, each representing a key facet of the nation. Lest the message is unclear, a text panel at left explains: “The octopus is freemasonry. It has France in its grip, and it binds with its long arms the army, justice, public instruction, clergy, youth, administration… all the living forces of the nation. She exhausts it and delivers it without defense to the Jew and to the stranger.”","Source of the Description":"Boston Rare Maps: Octopus map reflecting French anti-Semitism at the turn of the 20th century","Creator":"Paul Dupont","Link":"https://bostonraremaps.com/inventory/octopus-map-anti-semitism-1906/","Date":1906,"Publisher":"La Bastille","Place of Publication":"France","Source":"Boston Rare Map","Theme(s)":"Anti-Freemasonry, Anti-Semitism, Freemason","Format":"Journal Illustration","Circulation Area(s)":"France","img":"LIRE LA BASTILLE Journal Hebdomadaire Illustré ANTIMAÇONNIQUE [“Read La Bastille, the Illustrated Weekly Anti-Masonic Newspaper”].png"},{"Name":"La Pieuvre Germanique. [The German Octopus!]","Description":"A French cartoon map of Europe, mocking the ambitions of Kaiser Wilhelm II by showing him as an octopus. Upon taking his throne as Kaiser of the German Empire and Prince of Prussia, Wilhelm promptly worked to remove the chancellor Otto van Bismarck, who had essentially ruled Germany since the 1860s. The foreign policy decisions made under his rule are usually seen as disproportionately affected by his personal prejudices, although later evidence suggests that his views were shared and encouraged by the German upper and middle classes. However, Wilhelm\'s behaviour - taking the title of Supreme War Lord, supporting resistance to British and French rule in South Africa and Morocco respectively, trying to encourage Nicholas II to break the Franco-Russian Alliance - gave him a power-hungry reputation in France. The cartoon shows him as an octopus in a Prussian spiked helmet, reaching into all the countries around him. The caption dismisses his efforts, reading: When we cut the tentacles,What will you be left at the end?Perhaps Prussia!It implies that after the Kaiser\'s misguided attempts at asserting Germany\'s power in Europe have been curtailed, the only territory he will have is his original kingdom of Prussia, coiled securely in his only uncut tentacle. The trope of the evil, land-grabbing, octopus was common in propaganda maps at the time.","Source of the Description":"Daniel Crouch Rare Book: The German Octopus!","Creator":"Edmond Channel","Link":"https://crouchrarebooks.com/zh-hans/product/map/the-german-octopus/","Date":1907,"Publisher":"Varry","Place of Publication":"France","Source":"Daniel Crouch Rare Book","Theme(s)":"Anti-Germany Empire, Imperialism","Format":"Poster","Circulation Area(s)":"France","img":"La Pieuvre Germanique.png"},{"Name":"Landlordism Causes Unemployment","Description":"This polemic map shows the octopus of \\"Landlordism\\" strangling London.

The text at the side of the map says that Landlordism causes unemployment, paralyzes the building trade and \\"Pauperizes the Peasantry.\\" The text south of the river describes \\"Octopium Landlordicuss (Common London Landlord)\\" as a \\"Fishy Creature\\" whose tentacles \\"grasp 5 square miles of London,\\" an \\"Absorbent Parasite\\" that sucks 20 million pounds a year \\"from its Victims - giving Nothing in return.\\" The author, William Bellinger Northrop, concluded that \\"The People must destroy It or be destroyed.\\" See generally Jacobs 2017.The map was likely produced in 1909, the year that the author published his socialist work making the same points with the same data, \\"Wealth and Want. A Study in Living Contrasts and Social Problems.\\" (It is also the year shown by a postmark on the verso.) Northrop was an American free-lance journalist and photographer who spent many years in London. He was a frequent contributor to British magazines and the author of a collection of interviews and photographs, \\"With Pen and Camera, Interviews with Celebrities\\" (London, R.A. Everett & Co. 1904). His very different 1909 book (also illustrated with his photographs) attacked the inequalities of British wealth and concluded that \\"the breaking down of the land monopoly - both in city and in country - is vital to the welfare of the State.\\" Northrop 1909, 302. His proposed solution - \\"The One Effective Remedy\\" - was the imposition of a 20 percent tax on the market value of all privately owned land. Ibid. 316.Northrop\'s work reflected the views of the great British Liberal politician, David Lloyd George. Lloyd George had become interested in land reform as a young man, and first spoke out publicly against \\"the evil of aristocratic landlordism\\" in 1886, when he was a 23-year aspiring politician without office. Crosby 2014, 11. As Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1909, he presented to Parliament \\"a war Budget . . . for raising money to wage implacable warfare against poverty and squalidness\\" that included a 20 percent tax on the increased value of real property sold or inherited. Ibid. 90. As he took his land tax plan to the countryside in speeches, he was accused by The Times of \\"studious misrepresentations,\\" \\"violent invective,\\" \\"sophistry\\" and \\"pitiful clap-trap.\\" Ibid. 91-92. Northrop, for his part, was called by one reviewer \\"eccentric in his urgency and naive in his implications that land-ownership is the source of every evil\\" (albeit nevertheless \\"obviously earnest and sincere.\\").

While living for a short while in New York, he founded a well-regarded political journal, Némesis, devoted to attacks on American colonialism and Latin American dictatorships. Those two targets converged in November of 1903 when - in the classic instance of gunboat diplomacy - President Roosevelt sent warships to provide decisive support for the separatist movement in the Colombian “Department of Panama.” The U.S. immediately recognized the new, independent Republic of Panama, which in turn (and within days) granted the U.S. rights to build and administer the canal. “‘I took the Canal Zone,’ Roosevelt later boasted.” Goodwin 2013, 427. Vargas Vila responded with an article in Némesis entitled \\"Ante Los Bárbaros,\\" which attacked all three nations with such fury that he was forced out of the United States.

A. Kremer, attacking the mail order industry. It’s a bird’s-eye view of a metropolitan area as a giant octopus labeled “mail order houses.” The tentacles of the beast reach out to strangle general stores, groceries, hardware stores and other businesses in small, neighboring rural towns. While the city itself is not identified on the map or in the pamphlet, the skyline and shoreline strongly suggest Chicago - center of the nation’s mail order business at the time and long-time home of both Sears and Montgomery Ward. Wilson 2017.The pamphlet - 4-1/2 pages of text, in a small font, single spaced - tells the story of one “John Paul,” a successful and respected farmer in the town of Shelbyville, in an unnamed state. As a result of his prominence, John Paul is pressed to speak in lieu of an absent congressman at the Lincoln County Farmers Annual Picnic. He delivers a diatribe against the local merchants, calling them “leeches” and accusing them of gouging the hard working farm community. He concludes by promising that he will henceforth buy only from mail order houses.John Paul is so well regarded, and his speech so well received, that he is asked to give it repeatedly throughout the area, and his neighbors eagerly adopt his suggestion. But one night he is awakened by a terrible dream: that the city banks and mail order houses had grown into a gigantic octopus whose tentacles were wiping out not only the stores and shops of small towns, but all the businesses dependent on them. In the morning he drives into Shelbyville to reassure himself, only to discover that the dream had become a reality and the town was collapsing into bankruptcy. When the local bank failed, John not only lost his savings, but was repeatedly assessed as a stockholder. Wiped out, John lost everything, including his farm, which was sold at auction.Shortly thereafter, John once again addressed his neighbors at the annual farm picnic, this time delivering a lengthy mea culpa. He had “burned down his house to get rid of his tenant;” had been “killing the goose that laid the golden egg;” and had “betrayed my neighbors and friends by leading them from the paths of peace and plenty into the highway of of destruction.” Within months John Paul was dead, and the minister preached at his funeral that “whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.”There is a small farm community of Shelbyville in central Illinois, but no Lincoln County Illinois. This pamphlet was deaccessioned from the Library of Congress as a duplicate, and I have found no record of any other copy. The artist, Frank Pifat, served in the Wisconsin Civilian Conservation Corps in 1936, and the 1940 census reports that he was then 28 years old, with an 8th grade education, living on his father\'s farm in Oneida County Wisconsin and working as a \\"helper and cutter\\" in a meat market.The octopus is a persistent trope in persuasive cartography. It first appeared in Frederick Rose\'s \\"Serio-Comic War Map For The Year 1877,\\" ID #2272, about the Russo-Turkish War. \\"Once Fred W. Rose had created the \'Octopus\' map of Europe, it proved difficult to rid propaganda maps of them.\\" Barber 2010, 164. \\"The prevalence of the octopus motif in later maps suggests that the octopus also spoke to humanity\'s primeval fears, evoking a terrifying and mysterious creature from the depths (the dark outer places of the world) that convincingly conjured a sense of limitless evil.\\" Baynton-Williams 2015, 180.The collection includes numerous maps - from Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Latin America, the Netherlands and the U.S. - employing the octopus motif. (Search > “octopus”.) Many of these relate to imperialism and war, from 1877 to the Cold War.

The U.S. is portrayed as an avaricious octopus, with 11 tentacles encircling the Americas and reaching west in the Pacific and east across the Atlantic. Each tentacle is labeled with the date of American acquisition, from California, New Mexico and Texas (1848) to portions of South America (1941). A Japanese samurai sword dated 1942 is shown severing the tentacle that had previously surrounded The Philippines. The Pacific is dominated by Japanese aircraft and submarines, and the Atlantic by German U-boats, along with three sinking American ships. See generally Curtis 2016, 147-49.The text in the panel at the upper left is a quote from Henry Luce, founder of Life, Time and Fortune magazines. Luce was an internationalist and a powerful voice for American involvement in the war: \\"In 1919 we had a golden opportunity, an opportunity unprecedented in all history, to assume the leadership of the world - an opportunity handed to us on the proverbial silver plate. We did not understand that opportunity. Wilson mishandled it. We rejected it. The opportunity persisted. We bungled it in the 1920s and in the confusion of the 1930s we killed it. To lead the world would never have been an easy task. To revive the hope of that lost opportunity makes the task now infinitely harder than it would have been before. Nevertheless, with the help of all of us, Roosevelt must succeed where Wilson failed.\\"The panel at the left declares that \\"America lives by the law of the jungle. America for the Americans signifies that every country where the Yankees want to plant their flag, suddenly they are acting upon the Monroe Doctrine. The history of America is of imperialist plunder, where dollars were fired instead of bullets! It is the traditional policy of America, through the exploitation of European wars, to enrich themselves with the European possessions in the Atlantic and in the Pacific Ocean. Roosevelt also plans to use this war to benefit American world domination! [America] is seizing what the dying England has sacrificed!\\" The text at the bottom concludes, \\"But for the first time, America has miscalculated! Japan and Germany are encircling America in both Oceans. The Pacific fleet was destroyed at Pearl Harbor. In the Atlantic, warships and merchant ships are falling victim to the deadly underwater war. The tentacles of the Dollar Octopus will be cut. The gold of the international plutocracy, gathered in Fort Knox, is now surrounded by the irresistible armies of youth and the armies of labour.\\" (Translations Curtis 2016, 148.)Louis Manche was a talented Dutch artist who became a Nazi in the 1930s and produced a number of works of political propaganda during World War II.

In the 1949 National Council election campaign, the ÖVP put up a total of 26 posters directed against the Kpö, which used fear-mongering slogans to warn of the specter of people\'s democracy. One poster with the slogan \\"Recognize the danger!\\" showed an octopus stretching its tentacles across Europe from the Soviet Union (Fig. 3). With the slogan \\"You will become a slave of the collective farm!\\", merchants and tradespeople whose workshops and shops were allegedly threatened by nationalization were encouraged to vote for the ÖVP.","Source of the Description":"","Creator":"Austrian People\'s Party","Link":"https://onb.digital/result/115E43EE","Date":1949,"Publisher":"National Council Election 1949","Place of Publication":"Austria","Source":"Austrian National Library","Theme(s)":"Anti-Communism","Format":"Poster","Circulation Area(s)":"Austria","img":"Erkenne die Gefahr.png"},{"Name":"Eyes on Formosa","Description":"Published in the Richmond Times Dispatch, this Fred Siebel cartoon is a piece of American anti-communist propaganda and political commentary.

A sequence of events in the late 1940s and early 1950s prompted such concerns. The 1949 communist victory in the Chinese civil war was soon followed by Chinese invasion of Tibet and intervention in the Korean War. Meanwhile the communist-dominated Viet Minh were fighting the French in Indochina. In Malaya the armed wing of the Malayan Communist Party fought a guerrilla campaign against the British. Within New Zealand the widespread view of these events was of an international communist conspiracy, conducted by China but ultimately directed from Moscow. The \'domino theory\' became a common belief. This held that when one Asian country fell to communism its neighbour would be next, eventually directly threatening Australia and New Zealand.

The movie, Euromania is a documentary about the expanding powers of the European Union. Thus, this is likely a poster for a propaganda movie. Here is the IMDB introduction:\\n\\nThe European Union is rapidly becoming a more important part of the daily life of European citizens. National countries have decided to transfer important powers in an unprecedented way. Budgetright, energy policies, border control and monetary issues are all decided upon by Brussels. But what does this mean for people\'s lives and how democratic is this development? Filmmaker Peter Vlemmix goes on a journey to uncover the core of the European project. Who pull the strings, what are the agenda\'s for the next years and why is Euro-scepticism growing. Does the European Union provide a better life for European people, or is it benefiting a few? This is the question addressed by Euromania, a documentary film containing interviews with some of Europe\'s most influential policy makers as well as personal stories from people directly touched by European decisions","Source of the Description":"","Creator":"Stefan van Zoggel","Link":"https://www.behance.net/gallery/15761091/Euromania","Date":2014,"Publisher":"PV Producties","Place of Publication":"Netherlands","Source":"Behance","Theme(s)":"Anti-Political Annexation, Politics & Government","Format":"Poster","Circulation Area(s)":"Internet","img":"Movie Poster for Euromania.png"},{"Name":"TTIP is Good… for US","Description":"Since then, the FDP has not caused any more nationwide anti-Semitism scandals. Whether this is because it does not have an anti-Semitism problem remains questionable. A recent Allensbach survey found that 19% of FDP supporters agree with the statement that Jews have too much influence in the world. [20] In this context, it is worth mentioning the good relations that many FDP politicians maintain with Arab states and Iran due to the years of occupying the Federal Ministry of Economics and Foreign Affairs[21] - those states that have always rejected Israel\'s right to exist and have threatened to destroy the Jewish state if they do not start wars. In addition, the current party leader Christian Lindner is testing the limits of right-wing populism, whether by taking selfies with representatives of the New Right[22], stirring up sentiment against refugees[23] or advocating a rapprochement with Vladimir Putin[24]. In the current social climate, in which racism, nationalism and anti-Semitism are becoming increasingly acceptable again, the FDP is clearly not blocking this trend. This also seems to apply to its branches in Munich and Bavaria.","Source of the Description":"","Creator":"Dieter Hanitzsch","Link":"https://lbga-muenchen.org/2018/07/21/zur-veranstaltung-was-darf-karikatur-mit-wolfgang-heubisch-fdp-und-dieter-hanitzsch/","Date":2016,"Publisher":"Linkes Bündnis gegen Antisemitismus München","Place of Publication":"Germany","Source":"Left Alliance against Anti-Semitism Munich","Theme(s)":"Anti-Americanism, Anti-Semitism","Format":"Cartoon","Circulation Area(s)":"Germany","img":"TTIP is Good… for US.png"},{"Name":"City map : Osaka.

You can see a medium resolution version here. It\'s a 15 by 11 inch serio-comic map following the long-established approach of many cartographic satirists through history. Most notable among those is Fred W Rose who drew many in the late 1800s. Perhaps most famous for his Angling in Troubled Waters he also drew many maps with the tentacles of an octopus stretching out across Europe. I also like the work of Robert Dighton whose caricatures are wonderful, here in his series Geography Bewitched.With apologies to Rose, Trump\'s Ties uses the famously scotch-taped red neck tie as the tentacles of the metaphorical octopus spreading across the globe. The first month of Trump\'s Presidency has provided an obscene amount of obscene material and there was no problem filling in the map. Thanks also to Linda Beale and Edie Punt for some great ideas for content. No space for sea monsters or dragons on this map.I enjoyed this process. Getting back to drawing was cathartic. There\'s something very fulfilling about the creative process and, also, the method of crafting something unique by hand. My computer allows me to iterate out all the mistakes I can find on my digital maps. This was far more challenging because it had to be built and there was no room for error once the ink and paint started to be applied. And I had an immense amount of fun trying to cram all sorts of visuals in. There\'s even a cartographic homage to Ortelius but Kellyanne on a couch, Pence\'s own personal email server and travel ban Mk II will have to wait until the next one because I ran out of room. That\'s amusing in its own right...the map is already out of date as the list of banned countries has changed.Most maps I make I give away. This is a little different. I had thought of producing a limited edition but after careful thought I\'ve decided to make it available via Imagekind (who handle all of the printing and shipping logistics). It\'s $20.88 for a 15\\" x 11\\" print on enhanced matte paper. I make a small royalty on each which will be donated to the ACLU Foundation. You can purchase a print here.I hope to make a few more but it would be nice if it didn\'t become a monthly series of Trump inspired pieces. Frankly, the visuals would be a lot funnier if they weren\'t so true.","Source of the Description":"","Creator":"Kenneth Field","Link":"UIUC Map Library: https://i-share-uiu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01CARLI_UIU/gpjosq/alma99842624712205899\\n\\nKenneth Field’s Blog: http://cartonerd.blogspot.com/2017/03/trumps-ties.html","Date":2017,"Publisher":"Publish by the Author on His Blog","Place of Publication":"United States","Source":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champagne Map Library","Theme(s)":"Anti-Trump, Politics & Government","Format":"Blog","Circulation Area(s)":"America","img":"Trump_s ties _ a serio-comic map by Kenneth Field in 2017_.png"},{"Name":"Protectionist Ugly: Trump Makes Bad on Tariffs","Description":"Beware the beautiful blue-ringed protectionist, whose sting painlessly bul fatally paralyses its victin","Source of the Description":"","Creator":"Nuetzel","Link":"https://sacredcowchips.net/2018/01/29/protectionist-ugly-trump-makes-bad-on-tariffs/","Date":2018,"Publisher":"Sacred Cow Chips","Place of Publication":"United States","Source":"Sacred Cow Chips","Theme(s)":"Anti-Trump, Money & Finance, Politics & Government","Format":"Blog","Circulation Area(s)":"Internet","img":"Protectionist Ugly_ Trump Makes Bad on Tariffs.png"},{"Name":"John Bull and His Friends","Description":"Title: Nato must confront Putin’s stealth attacks with a new doctrine of war of its own","Source of the Description":"","Creator":"Patrick Blower","Link":"Vivid Map: https://vividmaps.com/modern-satirical-map/\\n\\nX: https://x.com/barronmaps/status/976183603783757825","Date":2018,"Publisher":"Daily Telegraph","Place of Publication":"United States","Source":"Political Cartoon Gallery in Putney","Theme(s)":"Imperialism, War","Format":"Newspaper","Circulation Area(s)":"United States","img":"John Bull and His Friends.png"},{"Name":"Coronavirus in the form of octopus envelops with its tentacles the globe","Description":"This map is a vector stock that can be used commercially.

We have forgotten about our Islands, which are still being colonized by imperialist entities (Spain, UK, US, Italy and France). We are encouraging all Africans who advocate for Africa’s sovereignty to educate themselves about the struggle of our islands and the US/Israel/France/Spain backed occupation in Western Sahara.Africas Islands: * France (Mayotte and Reunion)* Italy (Lampedusa and Lampione off the northern coast of Tunisia)* Portugal (Madeira Islands)* Spain (Canary Islands, Chafarianas Islands, Alhucemas Islands)* UK (Ascension Island, St Helena, Chagos Islands and Tristan da Cunha)AFRICA MUST UNITEFREE AFRICA’S ISLANDEND THE OCCUPATION OF WESTERN SAHARA IMPERIALISTS OUT OF AFRICASources:https://amp.dw.com/en/chagos-islands-the-fight-over-africas-last-british-colony/a-51372316https://thinkafrica.net/africas-islands/https://newafricanmagazine.com/3756/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/mayotte/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/reunion/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/lampedusa/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/lampione/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/madeiraislands/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/canaryislands/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/alhucemasislands/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sthelena/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/chagosislands/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tristandacunha/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/chafarianasislands/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/landback/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/freethepeople/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/panafricanism/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/homelandordeath/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/panafricanismorperish/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/defendafrica/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/organize/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/joinanorganization/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/allafricanpeoplesrevolutionaryparty/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/buildtheaaprp/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/buildtheaawru/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/aaprp/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/aawru/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/jointheafricanrevolution/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/liberation/ https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/handsoffhaiti/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/usoutofeverywhere/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/franceoutofeverywhere/https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/europeoutofeverywhere/","Source of the Description":"","Creator":"A-APRP International","Link":"https://www.instagram.com/aaprpinternational/p/DEx8GfrtDhN/?img_index=1","Date":2025,"Publisher":"A-APRP International","Place of Publication":"Africa","Source":"A-APRP International","Theme(s)":"Anti-Imperialism, Pan-Africanism","Format":"Instagram Post","Circulation Area(s)":"Internet","img":"Hands Off Africa’s Island.png"}]'),D={name:"DatasetView",data(){return{sidebarOpen:!1,selectedCard:null,currentDate:(new Date).toLocaleDateString("en-US",{year:"numeric",month:"long",day:"numeric"}),datasets:T,fallbackImage:t(38271)}},computed:{selectedDataset(){return null!==this.selectedCard?this.datasets[this.selectedCard]:null}},methods:{getImagePath(e){try{return e?t(36630)(`./${e}`):this.fallbackImage}catch(a){return console.error("Error loading image:",e,a),this.fallbackImage}},handleImageError(e){e.target.src=this.fallbackImage},toggleSidebar(e){this.selectedCard=e,this.sidebarOpen=!0},closeSidebar(){this.sidebarOpen=!1,this.selectedCard=null}}},I=t(71241);const F=(0,I.A)(D,[["render",S],["__scopeId","data-v-155fedb2"]]);var L=F}}]);
